## About

**Toucan Library** is a small CSS and JavaScript library that can easily be integrated into any web project. The library allows the developer to include [UI Elements](#ui-elements) and [Easter Eggs](#easter-eggs), making even the most boring website just a little more fun. Development of the library started in May 2020 and the first release was published in June 2020.

## Getting started

There are two ways you can implement the **Toucan Library** to your project:

1. [Download the files as well as include stylesheet and script to your code.](#download-and-include-files)
2. [Use npm to install the library.](#use-npm-to-install)

### Download and include files

Download the _toucan-library_ folder and place it at the root of your file structure along with your index file.

Include stylesheet in the head section as shown below:

```html
<head>
  <link href="toucan-library/css/toucan-style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>
```

Place the script immediately before the body tag closes as shown below:

```html
<body>
  <!-- Your content -->
  <script src="toucan-library/js/toucan-script.js"></script>
</body>
```

### Use npm to install

### UI Elements

#### Sticky Navbar

Tropic and responsive navigation with nice effects. Add class _'navbar'_ to a nav tag, div tag or whatever you want to make into a toucan navbar, place a div tag with the class _'navbar-toggle'_ immediately after the _'navbar'_ opens and create an unordered list called _'navbar-list'_ with the list items inside as shown below:

```html
<nav class="navbar">
  <div class="navbar-toggle">ðŸŸ§</div>
  <ul class="navbar-list">
    <li><a class="navbar-link active" href="#">Home</a></li>
    <li><a class="navbar-link" href="#">Articles</a></li>
    <li><a class="navbar-link" href="#">Products</a></li>
    <li><a class="navbar-link" href="#">Gallery</a></li>
    <li><a class="navbar-link" href="#">References</a></li>
    <li><a class="navbar-link" href="#">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

#### Text Elements

Exotic headings and paragraphs. Just add one of the shown class values to your h or p tags:

```html
<h1 class="heading1">Heading 1</h1>
<h2 class="heading2">Heading 2</h2>
<h3 class="heading3">Heading 3</h3>
<h4 class="heading4">Heading 4</h4>
<p class="paragraph">Paragraph</p>
```
